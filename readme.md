This is readme file for Breaking-3-XOR-PUF-using-ML-Linear-Model.
 Engineered SVM-based solvers and advanced feature mapping from scratch, effectively capturing XOR-PUF behavior
 Evaluated model on 10k training and 20k testing challenge-response pairs via primal gradient descent and MBSGD solvers.
 Showcased 99\% accuracy in predicting XOR-PUF responses even when faced with complexities of multiple PUFs
